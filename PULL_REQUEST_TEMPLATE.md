- [x] Variable are in mixed case with a lowercase first letter. Internal words start with capital letters. Variable names should not start with underscore _ or dollar sign $ characters, even though both are allowed. Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.

##Code logic
- [x] Code should be logical. e.g. no infinitive loop, no redundant variables, etc.

##Others
- [x] No unused imports/variables.
- [x] No sensitive information in PR like password, secret token, etc.
- [x] No hardcode.
- [x] Execution time should be ideally less than 15 mins.

##Did you test this issue fix on all browsers?
- [x] Chrome
